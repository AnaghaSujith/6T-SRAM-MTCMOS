# Low Power 6T SRAM Design using MTCMOS and Stacking

This repository contains the design, simulation, and analysis of a low-power 6T SRAM cell using MTCMOS and stacking techniques. The project was implemented and evaluated using **Cadence Virtuoso (90nm technology node)**.

---

## Overview

The goal of this project is to reduce leakage power in SRAM cells, which is critical in modern VLSI design for portable and battery-operated systems. Techniques used:
- **MTCMOS (Multi-Threshold CMOS)**
- **Transistor Stacking**
- **Power Gating with Sleep Transistors**

---

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- Cadence Virtuoso (schematic & simulation)
- 90nm CMOS Technology
- Linux environment

## ðŸ§ª Results Summary

| SRAM Variant | Leakage Power | Reduction |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| Conventional 6T SRAM | 11.33 nW | - |
| With MTCMOS | 227.2 pW | 97.9% |
| With MTCMOS + Stacking | 979.9 pW | 91.3% |
